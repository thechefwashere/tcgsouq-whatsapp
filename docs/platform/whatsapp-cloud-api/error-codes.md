# Error codes



The Cloud API is built on the Graph API, so if you are unfamiliar with handling Graph API error responses, see the [Graph API error handling](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/guides/error-handling) documentation.

In general, Meta recommends that you build your app&#039;s error handling logic around `code` values and `details` payload properties. These properties and their values are more indicative of the underlying error.

Code titles, which do not have a dedicated property in API error response payloads, are included as part of the `message` value. However, Meta recommends that you do not rely on titles for your error handling logic as titles will eventually be deprecated.

**Warning:** **Receiving Errors: Synchronous and Asynchronous**

Cloud API errors are returned either synchronously as a Graph API response, asynchronously via Webhook, or sometimes through both methods.

It is a good practice when working with Cloud API that you monitor both the Graph API response and the `messages` webhook for error handling. If you are subscribed to the `messages` webhook field, you will receive notification of errors as they occur for supported asynchronous error types.

## Error response webhooks and syntax

Cloud API errors can be surfaced in the following webhook objects:

- `entry.changes.value.errors`
- `entry.changes.value.messages.errors`

**Error response syntax**

```html
&#123;
  &quot;error&quot;: &#123;
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;&lt;MESSAGE&gt;&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;&lt;TYPE&gt;&quot;,
    &quot;code&quot;: &lt;CODE&gt;,
    &quot;error_data&quot;: &#123;
      &quot;messaging_product&quot;: &quot;whatsapp&quot;,
      &quot;details&quot;: &quot;&lt;DETAILS&gt;&quot;
    &#125;,
    &quot;error_subcode&quot;: &lt;ERROR_SUBCODE&gt;,
    &quot;fbtrace_id&quot;: &quot;&lt;FBTRACE_ID&gt;&quot;
  &#125;
&#125;
```

## Error response contents

| Property | Value type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | Integer | Error code. Build your app&#039;s error handling around error codes instead of subcodes or HTTP response status codes. |
| `details` | String | Error description and a description of the most likely reason for the error. May also contain information on how to address the error, such as which parameter is invalid or what values are acceptable. |
| `error_subcode` | Integer | **Deprecated. Will not be returned in v16.0+ responses.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Graph API subcode. Not all responses will include a subcode, so build your error handling logic around `code` and `details` properties instead. |
| `fbtrace_id` | String | Trace ID you can include when contacting [Direct Support](https://business.facebook.com/direct-support). The ID may help debug the error. |
| `message` | String | Combination of the error code and its title. For example: `(#130429) Rate limit hit`. |
| `messaging_product` | String | Messaging product. This will always be the string `whatsapp` for Cloud API responses. |
| `type` | String | Error type. |

## Example response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;error&quot;: &#123;
    &quot;message&quot;: &quot;(#130429) Rate limit hit&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;OAuthException&quot;,
    &quot;code&quot;: 130429,
    &quot;error_data&quot;: &#123;
        &quot;messaging_product&quot;: &quot;whatsapp&quot;,
        &quot;details&quot;: &quot;Cloud API message throughput has been reached.&quot;
    &#125;,
    &quot;error_subcode&quot;: 2494055,
    &quot;fbtrace_id&quot;: &quot;Az8or2yhqkZfEZ-_4Qn_Bam&quot;
  &#125;
&#125;
```

## Authorization errors

| Code | `details` | Possible reasons and solutions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | `We were unable to authenticate the app user.` | Typically this means the included access token has expired, been invalidated, or the app user has changed a setting to prevent all apps from accessing their data. [Get a new access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens#system-user-access-tokens). |
| `3` | Capability or permissions issue. | Use the [access token debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken) to verify that your app has been granted the permissions required by the endpoint. See [Authentication and Authorization Errors](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support#authentication-authorization). |
| `10` | Permission is either not granted or has been removed. | Use the [access token debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken) to verify that your app has been granted the permissions required by the endpoint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See [Authentication and Authorization Errors](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support#authentication-authorization).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For WhatsApp Flows with Endpoint - ensure that the phone number used to [set your business public key](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/flows/cloud-api/reference/whatsapp-business-encryption#set-business-public-key) is allowlisted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check the eligibility requirements for the API that you are trying to access. If you are not eligible to access the endpoints, you will receive this error code. |
| `190` | Your access token has expired. | Get a new [access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens). |
| `200` | No access token was provided. The API returns the message &quot;Provide valid app ID&quot;. This error occurs on certain GET endpoints (such as `whatsapp_business_profile`) when no token is included. Other endpoints may return error code 190 or 104 instead. | Ensure your request includes a valid access token. This is distinct from error code 190 (expired or invalid token). See [Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens). |
| `200-299` | Permission is either not granted or has been removed. | Use the [access token debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken) to verify that your app has been granted the permissions required by the endpoint. See [Authentication and Authorization Errors](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support#authentication-authorization). |

## Integrity errors

| Code | `details` | Possible reasons and solutions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `368` | `The WhatsApp Business Account associated with the app has been restricted or disabled for violating a platform policy.` | See the [Policy Enforcement](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/policy-enforcement) document to learn about policy violations and how to resolve them. |
| `130497` | `The WhatsApp Business Account is restricted from messaging to users in certain countries.` | See [WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy](https://business.whatsapp.com/policy) for details on allowed countries for messaging in your business category. |
| `131031` | `The WhatsApp Business Account associated with the app has been restricted or disabled for violating a platform policy, or we were unable to verify data included in the request against data set on the WhatsApp Business Account (e.g, the two-step pin included in the request is incorrect).` | See the [Policy Enforcement](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/policy-enforcement) document to learn about policy violations and how to resolve them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can also use the [Health Status API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/support/health-status), which may provide additional insight into the reason or reasons for the account lock. |
