### Sample Request

```curl
curl -X GET \
  &#039;https://graph.facebook.com/v25.0/17841405309211844?fields=mentioned_media.media_id(17873440459141021)&#123;caption,media_type&#125;&amp;access_token=IGQVJ...&#039;
```

### Sample Response

```json
&#123;
  &quot;mentioned_media&quot;: &#123;
    &quot;caption&quot;: &quot;metricsaurus headquarters!&quot;,
    &quot;media_type&quot;: &quot;IMAGE&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;17873440459141021&quot;
  &#125;,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;17841405309211844&quot;
&#125;
```

Note that in the sample above, the API has stripped out the leading `&#064;` symbol from the original caption (&#064;metricsaurus headquarters!) because the app user did not create the caption.

### Pagination

If you are using field expansion to access an edge that supports [cursor-based pagination](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/using-graph-api#paging), the response will include `before` and `after` cursors if the response contains multiple pages of data. Unlike standard cursor-based pagination, however, the response will not include `previous` or `next` fields, so you will have to use the `before` and `after` cursors to construct `previous` and `next` query strings manually in order to page through the returned data set.
